### General

This application is a single-page website portraying a potential consulting business.

It is created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) front-end component library.

### Origin

This project originated as a pre-enrollment exercise prescribed by [Learners Guild](https://www.learnersguild.org) and set forth in detail by [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage). Earlier versions were developed on the [Codepen](http://codepen.io/jpool/pen/jBxeRj) platform. Additional development took place during the author’s enrollment at Learners Guild in 2017–2018. The most recent revisions have aimed mainly to make the site more concise, responsive, and accessible.

### Accessibility

Efforts have been made, and are continuing, to make the user interface comply with level AAA of [WCAG 2.1][wcag] so that the application is reasonably accessible to persons with disabilities. Accessibility features already present include:

- Natural navigation order
- Explicit main and sectional region structure
- Semantic headings
- Mouse-free operability
- Descriptive titling
- Visible focus
- Contrastive colors
- Programmatically determinable control purposes
- Declared page language
- Textual descriptions of images

Further work is planned for:

- Textual descriptions of background images
- Enlargeability of text with reflow on touch devices
